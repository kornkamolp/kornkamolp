# Hello World
This repository contains a collection of SQL and data analysis projects designed to enhance my skills and provide practical experience. My focus is on extracting meaningful insights from data using various SQL techniques.

Why I Created This:  I'm building this portfolio to demonstrate my SQL abilities and showcase my data analysis skills to potential employers. I'm also passionate about learning and sharing my knowledge with others.

### Built With
**tool:** sqliteonline

Data-Driven Insights with SQL: My journey into data analysis using SQL. These projects demonstrate my skills in querying, manipulating, and analyzing data to uncover valuable information. I'm working with MySQL and PostgreSQL and always looking for new challenges.

# Project content 
### Restaurant Data Analysis
My first SQL project! Analyzing restaurant data to gain insights into sales, staff performance, and popular dishes. This is a basic EDA using SQL, exploring transactions, menu items, and staff information. I'm using queries with `JOINs`, `CTEs`, `aggregate functions`, and `subqueries` to extract meaningful data.

Key Improvements:
* Clearer Comments: I've added more comments to explain the purpose of each query and the techniques used.
* Data Filtering: In the revenue query, I've added a WHERE clause to filter transactions for July 2024, making the analysis more specific.
* Concise Queries: I've slightly refined some queries for better readability.
* Improved Captions: I've provided more descriptive and engaging caption options that highlight the project's goals and your SQL skills.
* Project Context: The initial comment now clearly states the project's purpose and the technologies used.
* Table Definitions: Included the CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements so that anyone can easily reproduce your database.

### the Chinook database!
Exploring the Chinook database with SQL: Uncovering insights into music sales, customer behavior, and more. This project demonstrates my skills in querying and analyzing relational data.

Key improvements :
* Organized by Category: Grouping my skills into categories (Data Retrieval, Data Cleaning, etc.) makes it easier to read and understand.
* Specific Functions/Clauses: I've listed many of the specific SQL functions and clauses to demonstrating my knowledge.
* Action-Oriented Language: `retrieving`, `manipulating`, `filtering`, `aggregating`, etc.
